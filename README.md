# todo-list-js
Todo List web app written in plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This app allows users to maintain separate projects (groups) of tasks. Projects are able to be created, deleted, and edited (project name only) while tasks are able to be created, deleted, edited, and marked as completed. Tasks can also be clicked on to expand them, allowing users to view the task's description. Additionally, the app implements persistent storage through the Web Storage API, allowing users to be able to save their changes within their web browser.

# Thoughts
I forced myself to create this project using plain old JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as a way to brush up on my fundamentals since it's been a while for me albeit there is still a lot of room for improvement. 

Along the way, I also learned a lot about JavaScript bundling through the use of Webpack and I can definitely see how useful and convenient it is to be able to bundle a bunch of files into a few to deploy.

I also learned a bit about the Web Storage API and how to store and retrieve data locally which may come in handy in the future. 

Overall, it was the largest coding project I've worked on in a while and I've learned a lot while still recognizing that there's a lot of room for improvement. Additionally, as with all coding projects, it always feels amazing to be able to complete a project, at least to the point where it's fully working and usable since as we all know, coding projects are never really fully complete!
